1. Product
CodeCowboy is intended to be a small-scale program which can be run locally and used by teachers at IUS. It is meant to not rely on any external sources such as AWS as well. The main functionality of the program is to run test cases on student-submitted code using GitHub Classroom. It is designed to best suite the needs of the computer science department at IUS. It is also meant to be easy to implement and maintain.

2. Technical Feasibility
The expectations placed on the CodeCowboys are reasonable and feasible. The skill level of our team will be adequate for us to be able to get the project into a working, deployable state. CodeCowboy is currently completely written in GO and heavily utilizes the GitHub API. It will be designed to run primarily on mac devices, but will likely support other environments as well.
