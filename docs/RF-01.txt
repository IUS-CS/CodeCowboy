1. Product
CodeCowboy is intended to be a small-scale program which can be run locally and used by teachers at IUS. It is meant to not rely on any external sources such as AWS as well. The main functionality of the program is to run test cases on student-submitted code using GitHub Classroom. It is designed to best suite the needs of the computer science department at IUS. It is also meant to be easy to implement and maintain.

2. Technical Feasibility
The expectations placed on the CodeCowboys are reasonable and feasible. The skill level of our team will be adequate for us to be able to get the project into a working, deployable state. CodeCowboy is currently completely written in GO and heavily utilizes the GitHub API. It will be designed to run primarily on mac devices, but will likely support other environments as well. 

3. Social Feasibility

    Our autograding system has the potential to greatly benefit teachers, students and schools.
    Teachers will be able to save time and effort on grading assignments, allowing them to focus on other important tasks.
    Students will receive quicker feedback on their work, which can help them improve their performance.
    One of the main goals for our project is to expand on the current autograding system, while maintaining simplicity and ease of use.
    Part of our planned improvments to the auto-grader include better, more user friendly interfaces that dont require additional teacher training.
    Our program integrates with canvas and github classroom, which are already widely used in schools, making it easy for teachers to adopt our product.
    We plan to make our system open source, so that teachers can customize it to fit their needs. As well as providing thourough doccumentation and manuals to help teachers get started.
    Overall, our autograding system has the potential to greatly benefit teachers, students and schools, and we are committed to making it as user-friendly and accessible as possible.

4. Economic Feasibility

    The economic benefits of our autograding system for teachers and the school are numerous.
    The time and effort required for grading assignments is greatly reduced, allowing teachers to spend more time on other important tasks, such as teaching, lesson planning and student support.
    More efficient grading for teachers is much more cost effective than hiring additional staff to help with grading or paying for more expensive grading software.
    The cost of implementing our system is relatively low compared to the potential benefits and to other alternative grading systems, as our system is ran off local servers rather than costly cloud services.
    Becuase this is a student project, we are not looking to make a profit, but rather to provide a useful tool for teachers and schools.
    This allows us to focus our efforts on creating the best product for our users, rather than on making money.
    Overall, our autograding system can help teachers be more efficient and effective in their work, ultimately benefiting teachers, students and schools.
