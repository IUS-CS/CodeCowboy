2024-09-18 Minutes:

We setup the GitHub repo and added team as collaborators. Then, we tested to make sure we could all access and write to the repository.

We then divvied up the work for the first report:
- Dale: Parts 1-2
- Garrison: Parts 3-4
- Andrew: Parts 5-7

Created some rulesets for the repository.
- Main repository requires a pull request to merge.
- pre-wip branch is read-only, and is to be used for reference.

We also analyzed the requirements for the project in more detail:
- Went over the project structure
- Discussed the Go programming language
- Reviewed what the first steps are for the project
